This was my first participation to [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/) :

*[AbbrevsMaster - davidB - 48 Hour Compo Entry](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/?action=preview&uid=20693)*

The Game
========

Goal : Become an AbbrevsMaster.

Find Abbreviation to clean the screen of its definition/translation and try to create a minimaliste view like "Google Search" and scoring.

Points : definition's length x number of occurences.

5 categories x 10 levels (each one have its own url).

Mainly tested on Chromium & Firefox

The LD Theme : minimalism
=========================

I make game with minimal gfx (triangle, cube,...), sound, ... daily (WIP Game). So I should do something different. I'm a fan of web design "minimalist" and "Google Search" page is a famous example. So start on a game with a visual like it.

And Abbreviation because, it's to write the minimal characteres ;-)



I hope you will enjoyed it, and you find some fun when you'll crunch abbrevs.

Thx
