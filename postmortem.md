[Post-mortem]()

What wrong ?
============

The game:

* abbrevs database
  * not tune, simple copy / paste from page
  * I failed to read data from a wiki page (github) due to security issue, spend too many time to try
  * Didn't find an online service that allow to request by category 
* No introduction (instruction, credits screen)
* Not enough funny juicy animations when traduction are crunched (quantity, quality)
* The fun is hidden, the game is hard

The process :

* not enough reuse
  * I didn't reuse all the code (lib, framework) I prepared during previous week
* very short night ;-)
* I didn't post progression, I was not aware of others participants.
* I failed my timelapse recording (glapse has no pause).
* Not enough preparation, I didn't follow my pre-roadmap
* Last hour on a stupid bug in audio
* Stack email, news, ... during 2 days
* I found the name (title) when I filled the submit form.

What Right ?
============

* *I submit a playable version (80% finished)* (last deployement at H - 30 min)
* I was able to reuse audio code (, build code from other project
* I toke time for my friends and familly (saturday afternoon)
* Using a kanban ([Trello](https://trello.com/board/ld26/517afacee4a0282247000a89)) vs todo file.
* I successfully try freemarker as css preprocessor (day 2, I should use it day 1)
* Very stimu
* Good wife'support (Thank you Darling).
